This is a toy project to practice my full stack skills.

## Backend

Backend is built on Spring Boot, with PostgreSQL database. I use Spring Data JPA to manage the database in java code.

## Frontend

Frontend is built by React, using React Redux as single source of truth. Frontend interact with backend by using axios to send RESTful request.
